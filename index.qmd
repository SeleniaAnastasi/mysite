I am Selenia Anastasi and I work as External Scientific Advisor for the Department of Political and Social Sciences, University of Catania (Italy)

I am a **methodologist** whose work consistently brings together **Feminist Theories** and **Digital Humanities**. My interdisciplinary approach combines corpus linguistics, computational linguistics and netnographic exploration to analyse **digital culture**, with a particular focus on platformed **toxicity**, **polarisation** dynamics and **gendered** forms of **participation**.

I have been a visiting researcher at the **Institute of Contemporary History** in Ljubljana (SL), at the **Centre for Transforming Sexuality and Gender** of the **University of Brighton** (UK) and at the **Language Technology Group** at the **University of Hamburg** (DE), where I collaborated with NLP experts to build and analyse a large-scale multilingual corpus from the **Manosphere**.

I have published in Italian and international scientific journals and, in 2019, I authored a monograph on the historical and cultural roots of Posthumanism (Lekton edizioni).

I also have experience as a web developer, writer for podcasts, social media, radio and newspapers, and a long-standing passion for transmedia arts.
