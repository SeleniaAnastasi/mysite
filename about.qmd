I am an experienced methodologist whose work consistently brings together Feminist Theories and Digital Humanities. My interdisciplinary approach combines corpus linguistics, computational linguistics and netnographic exploration to analyse digital culture, with a particular focus on platformed toxicity, polarisation dynamics and gendered forms of participation.

I have been a visiting researcher at the University of Brighton (UK) and at the Language Technology Group at the University of Hamburg (DE), where I collaborated with computer scientists and NLP experts to build and analyse a large-scale multilingual corpus. I have published in Italian and international scientific journals and, in 2019, I authored a monograph on the historical and cultural roots of Posthumanism. 

I also have experience as a web developer, writer for podcasts, websites, radio and newspapers, and a long-standing passion for transmedia arts.
